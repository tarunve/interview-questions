/**
 *  Java 7 enhancement:
 *  ==================
 *  -   We can write try block with resources.
 *  -   We won't need to close the resource as it will implement AutoClosable interface.
 *  -   If we don't write the catch block for handling the exception , it needs to be
 *      added to the method signature for checked exception.
 *
 *  Finally and catch blocks are quite different:
 *  --------------------------------------------
 *  -   Within the catch block you can respond to the thrown exception. This block is
 *      executed only if there is an unhandled exception and the type matches the one
 *      or is subclass of the one specified in the catch block's parameter.
 *  -   Finally will be always executed after try and catch blocks whether there is an
 *      exception raised or not.
