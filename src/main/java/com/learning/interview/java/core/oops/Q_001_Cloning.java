/*
 *  -   A clone is an exact copy of the original. In java, it essentially means the ability
 *      to create an object with similar state as the original object. The java clone() method
 *      provides this functionality.
 *  -   A class implements the Cloneable interface to indicate to the Object.clone() method
 *      that it is legal for that method to make a field-for-field copy of instances of that class.
 *  -   Invoking Object's clone method on an instance that does not implement the Cloneable interface
 *      results in the exception CloneNotSupportedException being thrown.
 *  -   By default, java cloning is �field by field copy� i.e. as the Object class does not
 *      have idea about the structure of class on which clone() method will be invoked.
 *  -   So, JVM when called for cloning, do following things:
 *      -   If the class has only primitive data type members then a completely new copy of
 *          the object will be created and the reference to the new object copy will be returned.
 *      -   If the class contains members of any class type then only the object references to
 *          those members are copied and hence the member references in both the original object
 *          as well as the cloned object refer to the same object.
 *  -   Apart from above default behavior, you can always override this behavior and specify your
 *      own. This is done using overriding clone() method.
 *      -   You must implement Cloneable interface.
 *      -   You must override clone() method from Object class. [Its weird. clone() method should
 *          have been in Cloneable interface.]
 *              protected native Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException;
 *
 *  Deep cloning requires satisfaction of following rules:
 *  -----------------------------------------------------
 *  -   No need to separately copy primitives.
 *  -   All the member classes in original class should support cloning and in clone method of
 *      original class in context should call super.clone() on all member classes.
 *  -   If any member class does not support cloning then in clone method, one must create a new
 *      instance of that member class and copy all its attributes one by one to new member class
 *      object. This new member class object will be set in cloned object.
 *
 *  Java clone best practices
 *  -------------------------
 *  -   When you don�t know whether you can call the clone() method of a particular class as you
 *      are not sure if it is implemented in that class, you can check with checking if the class
 *      is instance of �Cloneable� interface as below.
 *          obj1 instanceof Cloneable
 *  -   No constructor is called on the object being cloned. As a result, it is your responsibility,
 *      to make sure all the members have been properly set. Also, if you are keeping track of the
 *      number of objects in the system by counting the invocation of constructors, you got a new
 *      additional place to increment the counter.
