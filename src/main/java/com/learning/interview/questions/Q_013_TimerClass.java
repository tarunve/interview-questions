/**
 *	What is Java Timer Class? How to schedule a task to run after the specified interval?
 *	====================================================================================
 *	->	java.util.Timer is a utility class that can be used to schedule a thread to be executed at a certain time 
 *		in future. Java Timer class can be used to schedule a task to be run one-time or to be run at regular intervals.
 *	->	java.util.TimerTask is an abstract class that implements Runnable interface and we need to extend this class 
 *		to create our own TimerTask that can be scheduled using java Timer class.
 *
 *	->	Java Timer class is thread safe and multiple threads can share a single Timer object without need for external 
 *		synchronization. Timer class uses java.util.TaskQueue to add tasks at given regular interval and at any time 
 *		there can be only one thread running the TimerTask, for example if you are creating a Timer to run every 10 
 *		seconds but single thread execution takes 20 seconds, then Timer object will keep adding tasks to the queue 
 *		and as soon as one thread is finished, it will notify the queue and another thread will start executing.
 *	->	Java Timer class uses Object wait and notify methods to schedule the tasks.
