/**
 *	What is atomic operation? What are atomic classes in Java Concurrency API?
 *	=========================================================================
 *	->	Atomic operations are performed in a single unit of task without interference from other operations. 
 *		Atomic operations are necessity in multi-threaded environment to avoid data inconsistency.
 *	->	int++ is not an atomic operation. So by the time one thread read its value and increment it by one, 
 *		another thread has read the older value leading to the wrong result.
 *	->	To solve this issue, we will have to make sure that increment operation on count is atomic, we can 
 *		do that using Synchronization but Java 5 java.util.concurrent.atomic provides wrapper classes for int 
 *		and long that can be used to achieve this atomically without the usage of Synchronization.
